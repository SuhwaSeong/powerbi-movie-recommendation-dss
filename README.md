# Power BI Movie Recommendation DSS Dashboard

This repository contains the Power BI dashboard and related documentation for a movie recommendation decision support system (DSS).

## üèÜ Project Overview

This dashboard was developed as a group assignment for the ‚ÄúDecision Support System‚Äù course at the University of Europe for Applied Sciences.

**I was fully responsible for designing and building the Power BI dashboard, including all data visualizations, interactivity, and report layout.**  
The main project report was written collaboratively by all group members.

- Built an interactive movie recommendation dashboard with advanced filters and user-driven insights (dashboard fully developed by me)
- The final project report was a group effort
- The dashboard (.pbix) file is available via [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KDOg-i26a87CaU_9Gtf6W_UrGuTHvJRj/view?usp=sharing) due to GitHub size limitations

This project demonstrates my skills in Power BI, data visualization, and communicating results in a team-based academic setting.
